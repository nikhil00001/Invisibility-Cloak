# ðŸ§¥ Invisibility Cloak (Harry Potter Style)

A fun computer vision project using OpenCV that lets you create a real-life **invisibility effect** â€” just like in the movies! Wrap yourself in a red (or any solid-colored) cloak, and *poof* â€” you're gone on camera.

## ðŸŽ¥ How It Works

The script:
- Captures and stores the background for a few seconds.
- Detects the specific color of the cloak in real-time.
- Masks out the cloak and replaces it with the background.
- Gives the illusion that you're invisible.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

### ðŸ”§ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
